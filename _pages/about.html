<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>My name is Jingxiao Ma, and I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering from Brown University in February 2025, advised by Prof. Sherief Reda in the SCALE Lab. I previously completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham (2018) and an M.Sc. at Brown University (2020).</p> <p>My research focuses on efficient computing methodologies that bridge artificial intelligence and hardware systems. I am particularly interested in designing machine learning systems at scale through hardwareâ€“software co-design, with applications such as computer vision, recommendation systems, and large language models. My work spans approximate computing for energy-efficient circuits, dynamic neural networks for adaptive inference, and FF-INT8, an INT8 training framework using the Forward-Forward algorithm to improve training efficiency without backpropagation. Most recently, I explored LLM-driven chip design automation through the MetRex project.</p> <p>I am passionate about creating AI systems that are both scalable and efficient, capable of meeting the demands of large-scale applications while operating effectively in resource-constrained environments.</p> <p>Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano and watching anime.</p> </body></html>
