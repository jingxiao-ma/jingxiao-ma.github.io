My name is Jingxiao Ma, and I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering from Brown University in February 2025, advised by Prof. Sherief Reda in the SCALE Lab. I previously completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham (2018) and an M.Sc. at Brown University (2020).

My research focuses on efficient computing methodologies that bridge artificial intelligence and hardware systems. I am particularly interested in designing machine learning systems at scale through hardwareâ€“software co-design, with applications such as computer vision, recommendation systems, and large language models. My work spans approximate computing for energy-efficient circuits, dynamic neural networks for adaptive inference, and FF-INT8, an INT8 training framework using the Forward-Forward algorithm to improve training efficiency without backpropagation. Most recently, I explored LLM-driven chip design automation through the MetRex project.

I am passionate about creating AI systems that are both scalable and efficient, capable of meeting the demands of large-scale applications while operating effectively in resource-constrained environments.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano and watching anime.
